## The operation object

| Attribute | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| properties | An object that describes the parameters for the operation |
| required | Required parameters |

## List operations

It is possible to list all operations. [Try it out](https://api.rokka.io/doc/#/stacks/listOperations).

```language-bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.rokka.io/operations'
```
```language-php
$client = \Rokka\Client\Factory::getImageClient('testorganization', 'apiKey');

$operations = $client->listOperations();

var_dump($operations);
```

## Properties for all operations

All operations support the `enabled` property. It is set to `true` by default. If set to false, the particular operation
will be ignored for the rendering. This can be useful together with [stack variables and expressions](/documentation/references/stacks.html#expressions).

## Individual operations documentation

### Alpha

Does operations with the alpha (transparency) channel of an image.

#### Properties

- `mode`: String, mode to be applied. The default value is `mask`.
    - `mask`: Returns the alpha channel as grayscale image, removing all other information, including the actual alpha channel.
    - `extract`: Returns just the alpha channel of an image.
    - `remove`: Removes the alpha channel from an image. 
    - `apply`: Applies an opacity to an image, needs also the property `opacity`

### Autorotate

Rotates the binary data to the correct physical orientation based on EXIF data.

If width and height are given, it takes those values to determine the aspect ratio and turns the image so it has the
same one as the box given, if needed. The rotation_direction is only taken into account when width and height are set
and then overrides the one set in the image's EXIF data.

#### Properties

All properties are optional.

- `width`: Integer, between 1 and 10000. Width of the box to fit in.
- `height`: Integer, between 1 and 10000. Height of the box to fit in.
- `rotation_direction`: Direction of rotation to use, overriding the one set in the EXIF data of the image.

### Blur

Blurs the entire image.

#### Properties

- `sigma`: Number, minimum value 0. The default value is 4. Controls most of the blurring of the image.

### Circlemask

Puts a circle in the maximum possible area and alpha channels the outside of it to total transparency.
You most certainly have to crop the image before to get the desired result.

Example without any cropping:

Complexer example with cropping on the face, if the image has face detection metadata. Otherwise it just crops the image to a square:

Stack config:
```javascript
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "expressions": {
                "width": "$cropwidth",
                "height": "$cropwidth"
            },
            "options": {
                "anchor": "face"
            },
            "name": "crop"
        },
        {
            "name": "circlemask"
        },
        {
            "name": "resize",
            "options": {
                "width": 150
            }
        }
    ],
      "options": {
        "autoformat": true
    },
    "variables": {
        "cropwidth": "image.hasDetectionFace ? image.detection_face.height * 1.5 : (image.height > image.width ? image.width : image.height) "
    }
}
```
Output:
<img src="https://rokka.rokka.io/dynamic/crop-anchor-face-width-[image.detection_face.height*1.5]-height-[image.detection_face.height*1.5]--circlemask--resize-width-150/o-af-1/5adad6.png"/>


You can of course also just use fixed values for width and height, if for example what you need is always in the 
middle of the picture.



#### Properties

None yet



### Composition

Merges two images together to one. The to be added image (called secondary image) can either be another image uploaded to rokka or a fixed box with a defined size and color. You can also add additional transparency to both of them. This second image can be put into the background or the foreground of the initial image.

One usecase is to extend the canvas size of an image without resizing it. For this you define a new box with `width` and `height` and the optional `secondary_opacity`, `secondary_color` and `anchor`. Then you use `mode: "foreground"` to put the initial image in front of that defined box. 

The returned image is never smaller than the initial image. If eg. the dimensions of `width` and `height` are smaller than the initial image, it will return the full initial image. Therefore you can't count on having all the images returned from this operation having the same size, except if you put a `resize` operation before.


```language-javascript
{
    "name": "resize",
    "options": {
        "height": 450
    }
},
{
    "name": "composition",
    "options": {
        "mode": "foreground",
        "width": 1200,
        "height": 550,
        "anchor": "left_bottom"
        "secondary_opacity": 0,
    }
}

```

Or to fit a 4:3 image into a 16:9 box with white borders:

```language-javascript
{
    "name": "resize",
    "options": {
        "height": 160,
        "width": 90
    }
},
{
    "name": "composition",
    "options": {
        "mode": "foreground",
        "width": 160,
        "height": 90,
        "secondary_color": "FFFFFF",
    }
} 
```

Another use case is to add a watermark to your images. For this you have to upload your "watermark" to rokka as you would do with any other image and use the hash of that image in the option `secondary_image`. Then you use `mode: "background"` to put the initial image in the background of that secondary image.
 You can also use the optional `width`, `height`, `secondary_opacity`, `resize_mode` and `anchor` options in this mode.

```language-javascript
{
    "name": "composition",
    "options": {
        "mode": "background",
        "width": 160,
        "height": 90,
        "secondary_image": "ddc45f",
        "anchor": "right_bottom"
    }
} 
```

You can also use another stack for being included, if you have more complex rendering wishes and rotate it

```language-javascript
{
    "name": "composition",
    "options": {
        "mode": "background",
        "width": 160,
        "height": 90,
        "secondary_stack": "anotherstack",
        "anchor": "right_bottom",
        "angle": "45"
    }
} 
```

If you want to add some special stack variables to this secondary Stack, you can do so with using the `secondary_stack_variables`
option and setting them in an URL Search Query format. Search Variables defined in the secondary stack are also
automatically inserted, if you use them in the Render URL.
The following example would send the source image width to the secondary stack as stack variable `w` (and the height)
and could be reused there.

```language-javascript
{
    "name": "composition",
    "options": {
        "mode": "background",
        "secondary_stack": "anotherstack",
    },
    "expressions": {
        "secondary_stack_variabels": "'w=' ~ image.width ~ '&h=' ~ image.height"
    }
} 
```




#### Properties

- `mode`: Where to put the initial image, `foreground` and `background` are possible options.
- `width`: Width of the secondary image. 
- `height`: Height of the secondary image.
- `resize_mode`: If `secondary_image` or `secondary_stack` is used and `width` or `height` are set, the image is resized with this resize mode. See the [Resize operation](#resize) for possible values. Default: box
- `anchor`: Anchor where to place the composition, based on mode. See the [Crop operation](#crop) for possible values. Default: center_center
- `secondary_color`: Color to use as filler in hex without the # sign, example: "0F0F0F". Not used in when `secondary_image` is set. Default: 000000
- `secondary_opacity`: Opacity of filler. 0 is transparent. Goes up to 100 for opaque. Default: 100
- `resize_to_primary`: A `secondary_image` is resized to the primary `width` and `height`
- `secondary_image`: The hash of another image to be used.
- `secondary_stack`: The name of another stack to be used.
- `secondary_stack_variables`: The stack variables to be sent to the secondary stack encoded as URL Query Parameters.
- `angle`: Rotate the overlay by degrees. Default: 0


### Crop

Crops an image to a set size.

#### Properties

- `width` (required): Integer, between 1 and 10000. The new width for the image.
- `height` (required): Integer, between 1 and 10000. The new height for the image.
- `anchor`: String. Describes where the crop should originate in the form of `XOFFSET_YOFFSET`, where:
    - `XOFFSET` is either a number of pixels or "left", "center", "right"
    - `YOFFSET` is either a number of pixels or "top", "center", "bottom".
   
   Or it can also be
    - `smart` for smart cropping (where the most attention of the image would be)
    - `subjectarea` for cropping on the subjectarea, if one exists
    - `face` for cropping on a face detection area, if this was added.
    - `auto`. Default value.
   
   `auto` will crop the image centering the crop box around the defined 
   [Subject Area](../references/dynamic-metadata.html#subject-area), if any exist, then around a face detection box , if any exist.
   If both are not defined defined, the crop operation will fallback to `center_center`.
   
- `fallback`: String. What "anchor" should be used, when no subject area was found. Default: "center_center"
- `mode`: String. If width and height should be taken as absolute values or as ratio. If `ratio` is chosen, rokka will try to find the largest possible crop fitting into the image with that ratio. The default value is `absolute`. With `box` it takes a SubjectArea box for cropping, with `area` it tries to fit a SubjectArea into the ratio given by width and height. Possible values are:
    - `absolute`
    - `ratio`
    - `box`
    - `area`
- `scale`: Scales the crop box by that percentage. Especially useful when using the ratio mode and you want eg. only the middle 50% of the picture cropped. The default value is `100`
- `movearea_y` / `movearea_x`: Moves a SubjectArea by this percentage along the corresponding axes. Can be useful, if a face shouldn't be in the middle of an image for example. 

### Dropshadow

Adds a dropshadow to an image.

#### Properties

- `horizontal`: Integer, between -100 and 100. The horizontal extent of the shadow in pixels. The default value is 0.
- `vertical`: Integer, between -100 and 100. The vertical extent of the shadow in pixels. The default value is 0.
- `opacity`: Integer, between 0 and 100. 100 is fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent. The default value is 0.
- `sigma`: Number, minimum value 0. The default value is 0.5. Controls most of the blurring of the shadow.
- `blur_radius`: Number, minimum value 0. The default value is 0. Can be left at 0 for most operations. If you have a
                 deep understanding of how blurring operations work, you can use this to your advantage, otherwise you
                 are good with leaving this at 0.
- `color`: String. The hex code for the shadow colour. The default value is `000000`.

### Grayscale

Converts an image to grayscale.

### Modulate

Modulates an image for brightness, saturation and hue. Use this to for example brighten up or darken an image or remove its colors. 

For brightness and saturation, the input is an integer between 0 and 500, which is meant as percentage. The maximum value of 500 is pretty arbitrary, but more usually doesn't make any sense.

The brightness parameter applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear brighter or darker. A value under 100 darkens the image, while a value over 100 brightens it.
A value of 0 will create an image that is completely black, while a value of 100 leaves the input unchanged. A value of for example 200 doubles the brightness of the image.

The saturation parameter super-saturates or desaturates the input image. A value under 100 desaturates the image, while a value over 100 super-saturates it. A value of 0 returns a completely unsaturated (no colors) image, while a value of 100 leaves the input unchanged. A value of for example 200 doubles the saturation of the image.

For the hue parameter, the input is an integer defining how many degrees the color should be shifted on a color wheel. A value of 0 and 360 leaves the input unchanged. A value of for example 180 inverts all colors to their opposite color on the wheel. 

#### Properties

- `brightness`: Integer. Percentage of brightness change between 0 and 500. The default value is 100.
- `saturation`: Integer. Percentage of saturation change between 0 and 500. The default value is 100.
- `hue`: Integer. Degrees for hue rotation between 0 and 360. The default value is 0.

### Resize

Resizes an image.

#### Properties

At least `width` or `height` is required.

- `width`: Integer, between 1 and 10000. The new width for the image.
- `height`: Integer, between 1 and 10000. The new height for the image.
- `mode`: String. The mode of resizing to use. The default value is `box`. Possible values are:
    - `absolute`: Resizes the image to the dimensions given.
    - `box`: Resizes the image to keep its aspect ratio and fit into a box of the dimensions given, i.e. the dimensions given are the maximum dimensions of the resized image.
    - `fill`: Resizes the image to keep its aspect ratio and completely fill a box of the dimensions given, i.e. the dimensions given are the minimum dimensions of the resized image.
- `upscale`: Boolean. Whether to allow the resulting image to be bigger than the original one. The default value is `true`.
We advise to read [this blog post about resizing and responsive images](https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/things-you-should-know-about-responsive-images), if you want to turn this off.
- `upscale_dpr`: Boolean. Whether to allow the resulting image to be dpr times bigger than the original one, when the dpr stack option is set. Eg. If your image has 100x100 dimensions and you ask for a 60x60 image, this setting would upscale a `dpr: 2` setting  to 120x120 even when `upscale` is set to `false`. But it would upscale a request for a 120x120 image only to 200x200 (since a `dpr: 1` request would leave it at 100x100). This is to prevent, that a browser would display an image  with `dpr: 1` on a standard screen bigger than one with `dpr: 2` on a retina screen.  We advise to read [this blog post about resizing and responsive images](https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/things-you-should-know-about-responsive-images), if you want to turn this off. The default value is `true`.
- `sharpen`:  If set to `true`, rokka will sharpen an image when it's downsized and has an entropy > 5 (indicating that
  it's a photo or similar). 
  If set to `false` it will not be sharpened. The parameters used are the default values of 
    the Sharpen operator. If you want to have more control over those parameters, you can use the [Sharpen](#sharpen) operation below.
  You can increase also the entropy threshold via a stack expression, eg. `"sharpen": "image.entropy > 6"`.
  If you want to lower it, you have to use the Sharpen operation and set this here to `false`.
  Default: `false` 

  
### Rotate

Rotates an image clockwise.

#### Properties

- `angle` (required): Number, between 0 and 360. The angle of rotation for the image.
- `background_colour`: String. The hex code for the background colour. The default value is `FFFFFF`.
- `background_opacity`: Number, between 0 and 100. 100 is fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent. The default value is 0.

### Sepia

Applies sepia toning to an image

### Sharpen

Sharpens an image. Can be useful after downsizing an image, for example (when not already enabled in a resize
operation). The properties are a little bit hard to understand, but the defaults can be fine already. All the details
to the properties are explained in more details on [the vips documentation page about its sharpen method](https://www.libvips.org/API/current/libvips-convolution.html#vips-sharpen).
If you want more or less sharpening, we suggest you just change the m2 parameter (from the vips docs).
If you only want to sharpen picture above a certain entropy (pictures with low entropy, like diagrams, often don't benefit 
from sharpening), you can use a stack expression and the `image.entropy` parameter. The following would for example
only sharpen pictures with a entropy > 6.

```language-json
{
   "name": "sharpen",
   "expressions": {
      "enabled" : "image.entropy > 6"
   }
}
```

#### Properties

- `m1`: Number. Slope for jaggy areas. Default: 0.4
- `m2`: Number. Slope for flat areas. Default: 0.8
- `sigma`: Number. Sigma of gaussian. Default: 0.8
- `x1`: Number. Flat/jaggy threshold. Default: 2.0
- `y2`: Number. Maximum amount of brightening. Default: 10.0
- `y3`: Number. Maximum amount of darkening. Default: 20.0

### SvgDynamic

Adds/replaces dynamically attributes in an SVG Source Image.

Can be useful, if you need to change attributes like stroke-width, color or sizes depending on some input values or 
stack variables.

Can also be used together with the [`composition`](#composition) operation to put logos or graphics on to an image and dynamically 
change them, if you use it together with the `secondary_stack` and maybe `secondary_stack_variables` options there.

To do this, you define the attributes you want to set in an URL Search Parameters encoded string in the `set` option, with the element id
concatenated with a dot and the attribute name as key and the new attribute value as value. See the example, which makes that hopefully more clear.

Let's take this SVG as a simple example, you need to upload that to rokka like any other image.

```language-svg

<svg id="root" width="1000" height="1000" viewBox="0 0 1000 1000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" >
  <polyline id="line" stroke="#FF6840" stroke-width="10" points="10 500, 190 10"/>
</svg>

```

Then assuming you want to change the "stroke" and the "stroke-width" attribute of the element with the id "line", 
you'd define your stack like this

```language-json
{
   "name": "svgdynamic",
   "options": {
      "set" : "line.stroke=#ff00ff&line.stroke-width=5"
   }
}
```


But this feature is best used with stack variables and expressions. 

```language-json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "name": "svgdynamic",
      "expressions": {
        "set": "'line.stroke=#' ~ $color ~ '&line.stroke-width='  ~ $sw"
      }
    }
  ],
  "variables": {
    "color": "ff00ff",
    "sw": 5
  }
}
```

With this you can now control the control and stroke width via the render URL, eg. `https://your-org.rokka.io/stackname/v-color-663388-sw-10/$HASH.svg`.


#### Properties

- `add` (required): String. The Element-ID and attribute pair as key and the new value as value encoded as URL-Query-Parameter

### Trim

Trims edges that are the background color from an image.

#### Properties

- `fuzzy`: Number, between 0 and 100. Sets the degree of tolerance for pixel colour when calculating how much to trim from the image. The default value is 0.


### Text

For writing text on an image, use this operation. 

But before using it, you have to upload the fonts (as TTF format, there are online tools to convert other font formats to TTF)
you want to use  to your organisation through the normal sourceimage operations and then
use the hash (or short_hash) in the definition of this operation. A simple example writing a text in black in 
the middle of your image with font size 20 and the font with the hash "398a83":

```language-javascript
{
    "name": "text",
    "options": {
        "font": "398a83",
        "text": "Hello world",
        "size": 20
    }
}
```

See below for some more common parameters like `color`, `angle`, `opacity` and `anchor`.


#### Variable text through an URL

If you want to be flexible about the text written on the image, you can this like with any other parameter, eg:

```
https://$YOUR_ORG.rokka.io/text-stack/text-text-anothertext/dba893/a-picture-with-text.jpg
```

But we recommend using [stack variables](./stacks.html#stack-variables) and the `v` query parameter, since you
can't use any string in the middle of an URL. Stack variables also make it much more flexible, if you have
different texts on different parts of an image. The above example, you'd write the as the following:

```language-javascript
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "name": "text",
            "options": {
                "font": "398a83",
                "size": 20
            },
            "expressions": {
                "text": "$text1"
            }
        }
    ],
    "variables": {
        "text1": "Some example text"
    }
}
```

And then you send the content of `text1` in a json encoded object.

```
https://$YOUR_ORG.rokka.io/text-stack/dba893/a-picture-with-text.jpg?v={"text1":"Hello - Word"}
```

You can use that for any variable, not only for variables related to text


#### The width and height parameters

Width and height are a little bit special compared to other operations. You don't have to define them,
then your text is just written on one line.

If you define `width`, then your text is line wrapped at that point. With the `align` option you can choose
how those different lines then should be aligned (left, centre or right).

If you additionally define the `height` option, the text will not extend over that "box", but cut off (and
centred vertically within the box, if it fits).

If you define `width` and `height` and also the option `resize_to_box`, the whole text will always fit in
that box. But the font size is chosen accordingly to make that happen. The longer the text, the smaller the font size.


#### Examples and demos

See the [Watermark with Text Demo](/documentation/demos/watermark.html#watermark-with-text-demo) and
the [Templates with Text Demo](/documentation/demos/template.html#templates-with-text-demo) 
for some working examples
 
#### Properties

- `font`: (required) The rokka hash of a font to be used.
- `text`: (required) The text to be written on the image.
- `size`: The size of the text in pixels. Default: 16
- `color`: Color to use for the text in hex without the # sign, example: "0F0F0F". 
- `opacity`: Opacity of text. 0 is transparent. Goes up to 100 for opaque. Default: 100
- `angle`: Rotate the overlay by degrees. Default: 0
- `anchor`: Anchor where to place the text, based on mode. See the [Crop operation](#crop) for possible values. Default: center_center
- `width`: The width of the box the text should be fit in. If set, the words will wrap, if they reach that width. Default: null
- `height`: The height of the box the text should be fit in. If `resize_to_box` and `width` is set, the text will be resized to fit this box. If `resize_to_box` is false, the text will be cut off at this height.
- `align`:  How to align the text (if `width` is given). Allowed values: left, centre, right
- `resize_to_box`: Fit the whole text into the text box defined by `width` and `height`.
